# LSTM Melody Generator

This project is aimed at creating a deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for generating melodies. The model is trained on a dataset of MIDI files to learn the patterns and relationships in musical sequences.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
The following packages are required to run this project:
1. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
2. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
3. [Music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine

`git clone https://github.com/<username>/rnn-lstm-melody-generator.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory

`cd rnn-lstm-melody-generator`

### Usage
To preprocess the model, run the following command

`python preprocess.py`

To train the model, run the following command

`python train.py`

To generate the model, run the following command

`python melody_generator.py`
